This is the mini project done as part of the requirements at ME in AIML @ MSIS, MAHE

-> Developed a novel algorithm for detecting anomalies in multivariate time series data 
-> Python, Numba, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Subspace Linear Algebra 
-> Applied algorithm to power plant data with 6 continuous features sampled every 5 minutes over certain hours duration 
-> Comparison with deep learning LSTM-type models in progress
